Your C program uses an enumerated type to represent one of 100 states. You'd
like to be able to print out the state as a string (as opposed to a number) for
debugging purposes. Write a script that reads from standard input a file
containing

`
name
state_a
state_b
: :
`

Produce the file `name.h`, which contains

`
extern const char* NAME_names[];
typedef enum {
state_a,
state_b,
: :
} NAME;
`

and the file `name.c`, which contains

`
const char* NAME_names[] = {
"state_a","state_b",: :
};
`

How to use solution:
`cat test_input | python ex11.py`
